    "We can do E2E testing of a web application using a browser and a testing library. There are multiple libraries available. One example is [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), which can be used with almost any browser. Another browser option is so-called [headless browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_browser), which are browsers with no graphical user interface. For example, Chrome can be used in headless mode.\n",

    "\n",
    "They do have some drawbacks too. Configuring E2E tests is more challenging than unit or integration tests. They also tend to be quite slow, and with a large system, their execution time can be minutes or even hours. This is bad for development because during coding it is beneficial to be able to run tests as often as possible in case of code [regressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing)."

    "So [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) is a newcomer to the End to End tests, which started to explode in popularity towards the end of 2023. Playwright is roughly on a par with Cypress in terms of ease of use. The libraries are slightly different in terms of how they work. Cypress is radically different from most libraries suitable for E2E testing, as Cypress tests are run entirely within the browser. Playwright's tests, on the other hand, are executed in the Node process, which is connected to the browser via programming interfaces.\n",

    "Many blogs have been written about library comparisons, e.g. [this](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/cypress-vs-playwright/) and [this](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/playwright-vs-cypress).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to say which library is better. One advantage of Playwright is its browser support; Playwright supports Chrome, Firefox and Webkit-based browsers like Safari. Currently, Cypress includes support for all these browsers, although Webkit support is experimental and does not support all of Cypress features. At the time of writing (1.3.2024), my personal preference leans slightly towards Playwright.\n",
