    "There are two solutions to the problem. The first one is to limit the validity period of a token. This forces the user to re-login to the app once the token has expired. The other approach is to save the validity information of each token to the backend database. This solution is often called a *server-side session*.\n",

    "No matter how the validity of tokens is checked and ensured, saving a token in the local storage might contain a security risk if the application has a security vulnerability that allows [Cross Site Scripting (XSS)](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/) attacks. An XSS attack is possible if the application would allow a user to inject arbitrary JavaScript code (e.g. using a form) that the app would then execute. When using React sensibly it should not be possible since [React sanitizes](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#jsx-prevents-injection-attacks) all text that it renders, meaning that it is not executing the rendered content as JavaScript."

The drawback of this solution is that it would make implementing SPA applications a bit more complex. One would need at least to implement a separate page for logging in.\n",
