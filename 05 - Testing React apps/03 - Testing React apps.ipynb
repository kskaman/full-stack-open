When writing these tests, we made the conscious decision not to write unit tests, as the code for that backend is fairly simple, and it is likely that bugs in our application occur in more complicated scenarios than unit tests are well suited for.\n",

    "We could also make integration tests for the frontend. Integration testing tests the collaboration of multiple components. It is considerably more difficult than unit testing, as we would have to for example mock data from the server. We chose to concentrate on making end-to-end tests to test the whole application. We will work on the end-to-end tests in the last chapter of this part."

Snapshot tests notify the developer if the HTML code of the component changes. The developer has to tell Vitest if the change was desired or undesired. If the change to the HTML code is unexpected, it strongly implies a bug, and the developer can become aware of these potential issues easily thanks to snapshot testing."
