For example, if you decide to split a function into two separate functions, your code could break if you don't modify all the usages. This is difficult if you don't know where they are.

It also will not work if you destructure where you are importing; you have to import the named variable and then destructure, or just use dot notation to use the functions contained in the named variable.\n",
